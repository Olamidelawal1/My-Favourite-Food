        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>This is a rice dish from West Africa. With many african countries claiming to have the best recipe for this 
            particular food, it is best prepared with long grain rice and the Nigerian version is best prepared over firewood 
            to give the food a smokey taste and flavour. It is a very versatile dish that can be eaten with a number of accompaniment such
            as salad, plantain, moin-moin, chicken or any other protein of choice.

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. 
            This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste. This adds a deep and 
            rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.</li>

            <li>Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time
             this ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk burning them.
            </li>

            <li>Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when 
            the sauce becomes really thick and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water 
            is gone and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will know but just in case, you are still in doubt, 
            I would say maybe 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>

            <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt, white pepper (good but optional) and
            seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on point then, 
            I stir in my Rice. Make sure you stir the Rice properly until you cover each grain of Rice with the sauce. 
            Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not
            fitting enough, simply cover the rice with a foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because 
            Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>

            <li>Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice
            is done about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

            <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or Gizzards and plantains.</li>
        </ul>
